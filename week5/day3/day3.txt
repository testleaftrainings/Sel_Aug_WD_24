Hooks Implementation: Before TestNG intro
   Cucumber Annotations - > Hooks in Ruby Language
   its run before the scenario and after scenario
   Hooks:
       @Before :
          -is to have common precondition for each scenario
        @After : 
           - is to have common postcondition for each scenario


Steps to implement Hooks:
*Create a package called hooks and create a class called HooksImplementation
*Create 2 methods preCondition() and postCondition() and annotate with @Before and @After
*The Hooks class should extends BaseClass or PSM
*Add code inside precondition and postcondition and command out line feature file and stepDefinition
*In the Runner class inside glue attribute mention hooks package as well glue ={"steps","hooks"}


io.cucumber.java.InvalidMethodException: 
	You're not allowed to extend classes that define Step Definitions or hooks. 
  class stepDefinition.CreateLeadSD extends class stepDefinition.Hooks

io.cucumber.java.InvalidMethodException: You're not allowed to extend classes that define Step Definitions 
or hooks. class stepDefinition.CreateLeadPage extends class hooks.HooksImplementation


PSM-call the driver instance and extends to hooks,stepDefinition

ClassRoom1 :

Step-1 Add TestNG Annotation BeforeMethod and AfterMethod
Step-2 And copy code and paste inside perCondition and postCondition
Step-3 Command the common line in the feature file and steps package(launch browser and load url)
Step-4 Extends -> Runnerclass to BaseClass or PSM
BaseClass or PSM extends AbstractTestNGCucumberTests
Step-5 And executed from the runnerclass


Tags:
It is used to categorize the scenario

feature file: 

@smoke
S-Login->run

@dilip
S-CreateLeadPage

@smoke @sanity
S-editLead->run

@sanity @dilip @smoke
S-DeleteLead


Inside Runner :

tags="@dilip"-> CreateLeadPage

tags="@smoke" or "@sanity" -> Login,edit,delete
or-> 

tags="not @smoke" -> CreateLeadPage

tags="@sanity and @smoke" -> edit ,delete






tags="@smoke" )// only smoke scenarios will be executed 
tags="not @smoke")// it will exclude asmoke scenario  from execution
tags="@smoke or @functional") // To run scenarios that have either of the tags
tags="@functional and @regression" ) //To run scenarios which has both the tags
