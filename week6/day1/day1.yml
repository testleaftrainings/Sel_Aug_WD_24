-POM Parameterize
-POM with Cucumber



Static Parameterize:
- Create input agrs inside the method
-remove hardcoded value and replace the variable Name
-pass the value in TestCase level

Username and Password
pages-Create Input agrs in method
remove hardcoeded values and replace variable

testcase
Create Input agrs in method level
lp.enterUserName("demosalesmanger").
enterPassword("crmsfa")



POM with Excel Integration:
 create new Package as utils 
 copy and paste from program perv porject
 create folder and paste excel sheet

Create data folder and have the excelsheets inside Login CreateLead
Create a package called utils and have the ReadExcel java class inside
Create sendData() and annotate with DataProvider and call the readExcel() and return
Replace all the hardcoded data with input arguments in the required pages
In the testClasses, use dataProvider attribute to receive the data and pass input arguments in the test method.
Create setValues() in each testclass to mention the fileName and annotate with @BeforeTest


How to Parameterize the data?
	  1)Create a new package(utils) and copy the ReadExel class from the previous project or package 
	  and paste it here
	  2)Create a data folder and create excel sheets or copy and paste from previous project
	  3)Declare the filedata globally in baseclass or PSM
	  4)Create a method for @DataProvider and call the ReadExel class
	  5)Integrate @Test with dataProvider attribute and add name
	  6)Pass the inputs as arguments in the testcase method level and replace the hardcoded values
	  7)In the testcase create a method to mention the ExcelFileName and annotate with @BeforeTest























Cucumber with POM:
 - Create 4 packages
     - base
        Create BaseClass with common methods
        BaseClass should extend AbstractTestNGCucumberTests
     - features
         Create feature files
     - pages
        Create classes for each page and each page should extend BaseClass
     - runner
        Create CucumberRunner class and , mention glue="pages"
        The runner class should extend BaseClass
		
		
For TestNG:
if driver - > static
   only sequential execution is possible

For both sequential and parallel execution:
   Create constrcutor in each of the pages  by removing static keyword from base class


For Cucumber:
In cucumber with POM - constructor is not allowed

if driver - > static
   only sequential execution is possible 
   
   
If you want to have a hybrid framework combination of both TestNG + Cucumber

ThreadLocal
 It is a class in java for thread safety
 InSide BaseClass or PSM :
Steps: 1. private static final ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver> cDriver = new ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver>();

 private:
   It can be accessed only within the class
 static final:
    static+final = constant
 ThreadLocal:
   It is a class that provides thread-local variable

2. Use setter and getter methods
     Sets the current thread's copy of this thread-local variable
      public void setDriver() {
	cDriver.set( new ChromeDriver());

}
 Returns the value in the current thread's copy of this thread-local variable   
public RemoteWebDriver getDriver() {
	return cDriver.get();
}

@BeforeMethod
public void precondition(){
  setDriver();
  then replace driver variable into getDriver()
  getDriver().manage.window.max();
}

For TestNG _POM : - with driver as static -> sequential execution is possible
 - To have sequential and parallel execution declare Parameterized Constructor in each pages

For Cucumber_POM: 
- Constructor should not be defined 
- With driver as static 
-> sequential execution is possible



POM with ThreadLocal:

Thread safety when working with variable ina multithreaded environment .
it allows you to store and retrieve values that are specific to the current thread,

-Java Class to create variable which can be used to read and write within a single thread. 
ThreadLocal implementation of Webdriver will support TestNG parallel execution and cucumber

DisAdvantage:

As the constructor call is not allowed in cucumber
To acheive parallel execution without constructor in cucumber

==============================

To support both cucumberand TestNG

---supportsequential execution of both TestNG and cucumber

--not able to use for parallel executionof TestNG because cucumber is not supporting driver to be passed inthe constructor.

Add ThreadLocalclass in Basecall method 
private static final ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver> tldriver=new ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver>();


ThreadLocal:
Java class which is used to access each thread independently
 private static final ThreadLocal chDriver = new ThreadLocal();
private: - This variable can be accessed only within the class static+final
 - constant -> cannot change the value

private static final ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver> tldriver=new ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver>();

public void setDriver() {
    //Sets the current thread's copy of this thread-local variable
	chDriver.set(new ChromeDriver());
}

public ChromeDriver getDriver() {
    //Returns the value in the current thread's copy of this thread-local variable
	return chDriver.get();
}

add setDriver() method to @BeforeMethod

Remove the constructor from all the pages

Change the 'driver' to 'getDriver()'  in all the actions in the pages
Encapsulation:
 - getter and setter methods
